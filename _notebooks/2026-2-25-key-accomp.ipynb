    "\n",
    "Sprint 1 focused on understanding how a real development environment works. I created and managed my first repository using **VS Code and GitHub**, configured **Make**, and launched my **localhost server**. Learning how to commit, push, and pull code gave me the core workflow skills I now use in every project.\n",

    "Key topics I learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loops (Iterations)** — Repeating actions efficiently without rewriting code multiple times.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditionals** — Using `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to create decision-making logic, including nested conditions.  \n",

    "**Mathematical Expressions** — Performing calculations using operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Booleans** — Using `true` and `false` values to control program flow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON** — Structuring and organizing data using key-value pairs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Abstraction** — Simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary internal details.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings** — Manipulating and formatting text within programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Classes & Methods** — Understanding how classes define objects and methods define behaviors, strengthening my knowledge of OOP.  \n",

    "**Variables & the DOM** — Using JavaScript variables to update and interact with webpage elements dynamically.  \n",

    "### Teaching Experience — Arrays Lesson  \n",
    "\n",
    "I designed and taught a lesson on **Arrays**, explaining how they store multiple pieces of data inside a single variable and how each value can be accessed using an index. I demonstrated examples, connected arrays to loops and conditionals, and helped the class understand how they are used to organize and manage data efficiently. Teaching the lesson strengthened my own understanding and improved my ability to explain technical concepts clearly.\n",

    "\n",
    "In Sprint 3, my team developed a full RPG-style game using the GameRunner and GameEngine framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "My role was mainly organizational and structural. I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managed and organized project files in **VS Code**\n",
    "- Helped maintain a clean and structured repository\n",
    "- Coded the **NPC interaction system**\n",
    "- Integrated background elements into the level  \n",
    "\n",
    "Working on the main level helped me understand how larger programs are structured. Each level was built as a class containing the player, NPCs, background, and other game objects stored in arrays. Seeing how everything was organized inside constructors gave me a clearer understanding of how complex projects stay organized and scalable."
