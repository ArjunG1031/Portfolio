    "At Night at the Museum, I was honestly surprised by how many people showed up to see everyone’s projects. The room was filled with energy, and there were tables set up all around with different groups presenting their work. Each table represented a different class period, and every group had created a unique game that they coded themselves. It was really cool to walk around and see how creative everyone was with their ideas. The groups didn’t just show the final product—they also explained how the game worked, what website it was played on, and even showed parts of their code. I liked how they let people actually try the games instead of just watching a presentation. You could tell that a lot of effort went into designing and programming each project. Overall, the experience made me realize how much we’ve learned and how coding can turn simple ideas into interactive games that other people can enjoy."
